# megaroster
### xtern bootcamp 2017
### Create a new project from scratch that adds students to a class roster and meets the following requirements:

## Baseline Goal

* User can enter a name to be added to the roster.
* Name will be added to the end of a list.

## Bonus Credit

* Create at most one global variable.
* Fool around with Foundation and/or CSS to make it look nicer.

## Mega Bonus Credit

* Add names to the top of the list instead of the bottom.
* Add buttons to change the position of the student within the list. In other words, add “Move Up” and “Move Down” buttons.

## Super Mega Bonus Credit

* Add a delete button to every list item that removes the name from the list when clicked.
* Persist the student data using window.localStorage.

## Super Mega Bonus Credit Hyper Fighting

* Add a promote button to every list item that changes the appearance (e.g. changes the background color, adds a border, etc.) of that item when clicked.
* Make "move down" work if you haven't already.
* Allow the editing of student names after they're already in the list.
